            Hi, I'm Akshat! I'm a graduate student at UC Berkeley's School of Information focusing on the Product
            Management and Data Science track.
            <br>
            <br>

            Passionate about the convergence of business and technology, I embarked on my professional journey as a
            software engineer, pushing boundaries and developing innovative solutions. However, I soon realized my
            true calling extended beyond coding alone. Seeking a comprehensive understanding of business and
            technology, I am now pursuing Master of Information Management and Systems.

            <br>
            <br>
            Throughout this transformative program, I acquired a diverse skill set essential for excelling in the
            dynamic world of business and technology. Transitioning from a software engineer to a product manager, I
            blend technical expertise with a strategic mindset to deliver exceptional results. My coursework and
            industry projects also introduced me to the captivating realm of data analytics, enabling informed,
            data-driven decisions. Believing that skills alone are insufficient, I prioritize empathy and leadership
            for true success. By understanding stakeholders' needs, I champion their interests and foster
            collaboration.
            <br>
            <br>
            Beyond my professional pursuits, I actively engage in continuous growth, community impact, and promoting
            diversity and inclusion.
        </p>
